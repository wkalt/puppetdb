;; ## Performance counters

;; For each command (and globally), add command-processing
;; metrics. The hierarchy of command-processing metrics has the
;; following form:
;;
;;     {"global"
;;        {:seen <meter>
;;         :processed <meter>
;;         :fatal <meter>
;;         :retried <meter>
;;         :discarded <meter>
;;         :processing-time <timer>
;;         :retry-counts <histogram>
;;        }
;;      "command name"
;;        {<version number>
;;           {:seen <meter>
;;            :processed <meter>

;;            :retry-counts <histogram>
;;           }
;;        }
;;     }
;;
;; The `"global"` hierarchy contains metrics aggregated across all
;; commands.
;;
;; * `:seen`: the number of commands (valid or not) encountered
;;
;; * `:processeed`: the number of commands successfully processed
;;
;; * `:fatal`: the number of fatal errors
;;
;; * `:retried`: the number of commands re-queued for retry
;;
;; * `:discarded`: the number of commands discarded for exceeding the
;;   maximum allowable retry count
;;
;; * `:processing-time`: how long it takes to process a command
;;
;; * `:retry-counts`: histogram containing the number of times
;;   messages have been retried prior to suceeding

;;

;; set of _middleware_ functions. That is, higher-order functions that
;; add capabilities to an existing message-handling
;; function. Middleware can be stacked, creating sophisticated
;; hierarchies of functionality. And because each middleware function
;; is isolated in terms of capability, testability is much simpler.
;;
;; It's not an original idea; it was stolen from _Ring's_ middleware
;; architecture.
